Secret Game is a live-action, mobile-first social game designed for large groups in real-world settings. It transforms a physical space, like a park, into a game arena where players are assigned secret targets to "eliminate" through fun, social challenges. The game acts as a powerful social lubricant for large events, encouraging guests to interact with new people and explore their surroundings in a playful, structured way.

## Key Features

-   **Live Social Gameplay:** Built for in-person events to turn any party into a dynamic, interactive experience.
-   **Circular Targeting:** Every player is hunting one other player and being hunted by another, creating a balanced circle of suspense.
-   **Dual-Confirmation Kill System:** Eliminations require confirmation from both the assassin and the target via a real-time WebSocket backend, ensuring fair play.
-   **Living & Dead States:** Eliminated players aren't out of the game; they switch to completing environmental and social quests that encourage interaction with the space and other people.
-   **Real-time & Responsive:** Built with a modern React/TypeScript and Node.js stack, the game provides instant updates and is fully optimized for mobile devices.

## How to Play

1.  **Join the Game**: Open the [live game link](https://rustin-secret-game-rustinpartow-rustin-john-partows-projects.vercel.app/), enter your name, and get a unique, Rustin-themed monster avatar.
2.  **Receive Your Target**: You'll be secretly assigned one other player to "eliminate."
3.  **Complete Your Mission**: Your mission is a subtle social challenge (e.g., "get your target to sing a song").
4.  **Confirm the Kill**: Once you complete the mission, declare it in the app. Your target must then confirm your success.
5.  **Become a Quester**: If you are eliminated, you'll receive environmental and creative quests to complete around the event area.
